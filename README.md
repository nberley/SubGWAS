This script provides a basic framework for some of the analyses described in the following paper. 

Shigemizu, D., Akiyama, S., Suganuma, M. et al. Classification and deep-learningâ€“based prediction of Alzheimer disease subtypes by using genomic data. Transl Psychiatry 13, 232 (2023). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-023-02531-1

Here's a brief explanation of each part:

The load_gwas_data function is a placeholder for loading GWAS data.

The perform_logistic_regression function uses scikit-learn to perform logistic regression, which was used in the paper for association analysis.

The DeepNN class and train_neural_network function implement a deep neural network similar to the one described in the paper. It has six hidden layers with 512 neurons each, uses ReLU activation and dropout, and outputs probabilities for four classes (LOAD group 1, LOAD group 2, CN group 1, CN group 2).

The analyze_blood_markers function performs Wilcoxon rank-sum tests on blood marker data, as described in the paper.
